:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
- This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.
- Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.
- The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.
- A significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what commands need to be run and how to run them.
