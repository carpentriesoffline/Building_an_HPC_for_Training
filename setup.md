title: Setup
---

For this lesson you will need:

- 2 computers (eg. two Raspberry Pis or laptops), one which will serve as the 
login node and one which will be a compute node. These do not need keyboards 
and screens but it is sometimes handy to have a keyboard and screen for when 
you run into trouble.
- One network switch.
- One laptop or computer which will serve as your workstation. It might prove
useful for this workstation to have an ethernet port.
- Three network cables.
- If your switch has Power over Ethernet (PoE) you might not need power supplies
for your two node. If they don't, don't forget the power supplies. Also don't 
forget the power supply for the switch itself.
- You'll need at least one SD card if you are using Raspberry Pis or any other
single board computer (SBC). It might be helpful if you have two in case PXE 
(Preboot eXecution Environment) doesn't want to work.

### Details

Setup for different systems can be presented in dropdown menus via a `spoiler`
tag. They will join to this discussion block, so you can give a general overview
of the software used in this lesson here and fill out the individual operating
systems (and potentially add more, e.g. online setup) in the solutions blocks.
